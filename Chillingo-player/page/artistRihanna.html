            Popstar Rihanna signed with Def Jam records at age 16 and in 2005 released her first album Music of the Sun,
            which sold more than two million copies worldwide. She went on to release more albums and an array of hit
            songs, including "Unfaithful," "Umbrella," "Disturbia," "Take a Bow," "Diamonds" and "We Found Love." A
            global pop star with an unrelentingly edgy image, Rihanna has also won multiple industry accolades,
            including Grammys and MTV awards.
